## About Me

I am a **PhD student at the University of Washington** in Seattle and an affiliate student of the Max Planck School of Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. I think of myself as a social demographer and quantiatives medical sociologist whose work lays at the intersection of population health inequities and healthcare access. My research interests and experience also include the nexus between population dynamics and environment, and maternal and child health. 

I have a **MSc in Demography** from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and **BS in Public Health** from the University of Colorado Denver.

My disserataion is centered on the evolving healthcare access before and after the desegregation of American hosptials during the civil rights era. I use quantitative and demographic methods to understand how the social and political sphere affected healthcare access and health trajectories.

[“Mom-and-Pop” Landlords and Regulatory Backlash: A Seattle Case Study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231241296169)

Against the backdrop of an acute rental affordability crisis and a resurgent tenant’s rights movement, rental industry groups have frequently argued that tenant protection laws disproportionately harm “mom-and-pop” landlords and, by extension, the disadvantaged tenants they serve. In this paper, we leverage a changing regulatory environment in Seattle to provide a rare empirical interrogation of these claims. This analysis of a novel set of consumer data linked with parcel records provides no evidence that tenant protection laws drove “mom-and-pop” landlords out of the rental market. Moreover, an analysis of a survey of almost 4,000 Seattle landlords suggests that “mom-and-pop” landlords use management practices that are largely similar to those used by landlords with larger rental portfolios. These findings run counter to pervasive political narratives regarding the detrimental effects of tenant protection regulations on the small-scale rental sector and bring needed attention to the repercussions of claims-making for stratification in the housing context.

[Book Chapter in Computational Demography and Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13056)

Recent developments in computing, data entry and generation, and analytic tools have changed the landscape of modern demography and health research. These changes have come to be known as computational demography, big data, and precision health in the field. This emerging interdisciplinary research comprises social scientists, physical scientists, engineers, data scientists, and disease experts. This work has changed how we use administrative data, conduct surveys, and allow for complex behavioral studies via big data (electronic trace data from mobile phones, apps, etc.). This chapter reviews this emerging field's new data sources, methods, and applications.

[Estimates and trends of zero vegetable or fruit consumption among children aged 6–23 months in 64 countries](https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0001662)

Children require a diverse diet, that includes vegetables and fruits, to support growth and development and prevent non-communicable diseases. The WHO-UNICEF established a new infant and young child feeding (IYCF) indicator: zero vegetable or fruit (ZVF) consumption among children aged 6–23 months. We estimated the prevalence, trends, and factors associated with ZVF consumption using nationally representative, cross-sectional data on child health and nutrition in low-and-middle-income countries. We examined 125 Demographic and Health Surveys in 64 countries conducted between 2006–2020 with data on whether a child ate vegetables or fruits the previous day. Prevalence of ZVF consumption was calculated by country, region, and globally. Country trends were estimated and tested for statistical significance (p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between ZVF and child, mother, household, and survey cluster characteristics by world region and globally. Using a pooled estimate of the most recent survey available in each country, we estimate the global prevalence of ZVF consumption as 45.7%, with the highest prevalence in West and Central Africa (56.1%) and the lowest in Latin America and the Caribbean (34.5%). Recent trends in ZVF consumption varied by country (16 decreasing, eight increasing, 14 no change). Country trends in ZVF consumption represented diverse patterns of food consumption over time and may be affected by the timing of surveys. Children from wealthier households and children of mothers who are employed, more educated, and have access to media were less likely to consume ZVF. We find the prevalence of children aged 6–23 months who do not consume any vegetables or fruits is high and is associated with wealth and characteristics of the mother. Areas for future research include generating evidence from low-and-middle-income countries on effective interventions and translating strategies from other contexts to improve vegetable and fruit consumption among young children.
