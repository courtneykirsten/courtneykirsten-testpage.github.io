## About Me

I am a **PhD student at the University of Washington** in Seattle and an affiliate student of the Max Planck School of Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. 

---
I think of myself as a social demographer and quantiatives medical sociologist whose work lays at the intersection of population health inequities and healthcare access. My research interests and experience also include the nexus between population dynamics and environment, and maternal and child health. 

I have a **MSc in Demography** from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and **BS in Public Health** from the University of Colorado Denver.

My dissertaion is centered on the evolving healthcare access before and after the desegregation of American hosptials during the civil rights era. I use quantitative and demographic methods to understand how the social and political sphere affected healthcare access and health trajectories.
